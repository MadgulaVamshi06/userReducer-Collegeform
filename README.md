This code represents a React application for handling a college form using the useReducer hook for state management. Here's an overview of its functionality:

Initial State: 
The initialState object defines the structure of the form data, including fields such as college name, establishment year, address details, and courses offered.

Reducer Function: 
The formReducer function specifies how the state should be updated based on different actions dispatched to it.
Actions like updating form fields, address details, latitude, longitude, adding courses, and resetting the form are handled within the reducer.

State Management with useReducer: 
The useReducer hook is used to manage the state of the form data. 
It provides a centralized way to update the state based on dispatched actions, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code compared
to managing state individually for each field.

Form Input Handlers:
Various input change handlers (handleInputChange, handleAddressChange, handleCityChange, handleLocalityChange, handleAddressLatitude, handleAddressLongitude, handleAddCourse) are defined to update the state based on user input.
These handlers dispatch the corresponding actions to the reducer to update the state accordingly.

Form Submission and Reset: 
The handleSubmit function is triggered when the form is submitted, setting the submitted state to true and logging the form data to the console. 
The handleReset function resets the form to its initial state when the reset button is clicked.

Displaying Form Data: Conditional rendering is used to display the submitted form data (state) when the form is submitted. 
If the form has not been submitted yet, a message indicating the same is displayed.

Overall, this code demonstrates a structured approach to managing form data in a React application using the useReducer hook,
improving code organization and maintainability.
